The SAP Business Application Studio extension framework allows you to add new project and module templates to ease project creation. You can enrich the IDE with tools that will help you develop faster and more efficiently, such as code assist, static code analysis, and code formatting. Likewise, you can integrate your IDE with external services and systems.

The extension framework allows you to extend SAP Business Application Studio in 2 different ways:

-   **Extend a specific dev space with VS Code extensions and Yeoman generators.** 

    -   Search the Open VSX Registry for additional VS Code extensions to install directly on your dev space.

        See [Explore and Install VS Code Extensions](Explore_and_Install_VS_Code_Extensions_d83a580.md).

    -   Search and install open source generators to add the most suitable templates for your wizards.

        See [Explore and Install Generators](Explore_and_Install_Generators_7865b5e.md).

-   **Create your own SAP Business Application Studio extension**.

    -   Package VS Code extensions and Yeoman generators into an SAP Business Application Studio extension and then deploy it to the subaccount in which your team is working. All the team members can then enable the extension from the Dev Space Manager.
