# Hide Controls

You can hide a specific control of the original application.



## Context

Controls that are configured in a fragment that is loaded dynamically might still appear in the UI. Elements that are set as *visible* manually by the viewâ€™s controller will not be hidden.

You can try and hide these controls by replacing the view or extending the controller that hides it and override the method.



## Procedure

1.  In the *File Explorer*, navigate to the extension project to which you want to add the extension.

2.  Right-click the `.extconfig.json` file and click *Create Extension*.

3.  Make sure that the desired extension project is selected and click *Next*.

4.  Select *Hide Control* and click *Next*.

5.  Select the view or fragment containing the control that you want to hide.

6.  Select the specific control that you want to hide.

    > ### Note:  
    > Only controls with an ID that is defined in the original application appear in the list.

7.  Click *Next*.

8.  Click *Finish* to add the extension to the selected extension project.

    > ### Note:  
    > You can only hide controls that have their `Visible` property defined as `true`. If the `Visible` property does not exist, you cannot hide the control.

    > ### Note:  
    > If you hide a control and then want to show it again, you must delete the extension from the `component.js/manifest.json` customizing block. Changing the `visible` property from `False` to `True` does not make the control reappear.
