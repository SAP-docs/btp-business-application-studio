# Dev Spaces in SAP Business Application Studio

A dev space is a development environment with the tools, capabilities, and resources needed for developing your application.



A dev space provides tailored tools and pre-installed runtimes for your business scenario. This simplifies and saves time in setting up your development environment and allows you to efficiently develop, test, build, and run your solution locally or in the cloud.

Each dev space type contains a set of predefined extensions that help improve your experience.

An SAP Business Application Studio extension is a set of tools that help you perform a specific development task. For example, the *Java Tools* extension provides you with the tools that you need to develop a Java application. The *Fiori Tools* extension includes the templates, CLI, and code completion required to create an SAP Fiori application.

You can choose to add additional extensions to a dev space which will provide additional tools to supplement the application with additional components for the scenario to your developer environment. See [Additional Extensions](Additional_Extensions_7188fed.md).

When creating a new dev space, select the dev space type that best fits the application you want to create. See [Dev Space Types](Dev_Space_Types_4142f78.md).

## Configure Your Dev Space Settings

You can configure your preferred settings for working in the dev space:

1.  Open your dev space.
2.  Go to *File* \> *Settings*.
3.  Configure your settings:
    -   Keyboard shortcuts
    -   Color theme
    -   File icon theme
    -   General preferences

> ### Note:  
> Settings are relevant per dev space. You must configure your settings for each dev space separately.

You can create, delete, stop, and start dev spaces. You can also download dev space content, and import dev space content. See [Working in the Dev Space Manager](Working_in_the_Dev_Space_Manager_ad40d52.md).

> ### Note:  
> Dev spaces not used for more than 30 days are archived to save on disk space. You can still access them just like any other dev space, but they might take up to 1 minute longer to load.

## Using Additional Tools

It is possible to install additional tools on a dev space or consume additional software components for developing applications using the terminal, the dedicated UI, or directly in the code.

> ### Note:  
> SAP provides you with a mechanism to access third party sites to view and download open-source, 3rd party or its own tools, libraries, or software components \(“Extensions”\) to dev spaces in SAP Business Application Studio. Using this mechanism, you can view and install Extensions at your own risk.
> 
> SAP does not certify or endorse any of the third-party sites or Extensions, and they are not part of SAP Business Application Studio.
> 
> You must ensure that you have all the necessary rights to use these Extensions.
> 
> You are responsible for all aspects of the Extensions, including maintenance, management, security, and support.
> 
> You will assume all responsibility for any negative effects caused by or relating to the Extensions.
> 
> SAP may disable any dev space that includes Extensions that cause system malfunction or that SAP reasonably believes may cause harm to SAP systems.
