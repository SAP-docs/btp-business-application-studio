## Storyboard

From the storyboard, you can trigger the graphical editors as well as other tools required to develop an SAP Fiori elements application.

The storyboard provides a graphical view of an application's external services and UI front ends, as well as the connections between them. This allows for a quick understanding of the applicationâ€™s structure and components.

You can move, zoom in and out, and expand and collapse a single component, or all components at once. You can also select a single component and edit its properties in its graphical modeler.
