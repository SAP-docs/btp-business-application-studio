# Add Controls from the Controls Tab

Add controls to the canvas by using drag and drop functionality.

Select the control that you want to add to the canvas from the *Controls* tab on the left side of the layout editor area and drag it to the drop target on the canvas. A tooltip displays the drop targets as you drag the control around the canvas.



If you want to add an *HBox* container with a *Button* control to your view, do the following:

1.  Choose the *Controls* tab.
2.  Open the *Container* section by clicking the arrow to the right of the section title.
3.  Select the *HBox* control and drag it to the canvas. Drop it at the position where you want it to appear.
4.  Open the *Action* section by clicking the arrow to the right of the section title.
5.  Select the *Button* control and drag it to the canvas.
6.  Drop the *Button* control onto the *HBox* container.
