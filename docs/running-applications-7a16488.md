## You receive a notification stating that the port is in use, even though you stopped an application

**Problem**

An application continues to run in the background even if the debugger and/or the explorer show it has been stopped.

**Solution**

To correct this:

1.  Open the command palette and select *Ports: Stop the process running on the port*.
2.  Select the relevant port.

> ### Note:  
> This action cannot be reversed. Make sure you select the correct port.
