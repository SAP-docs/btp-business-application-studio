# Pull Changes in the Simplified View

In the *SIMPLIFIED GIT* view, you can pull changes to download objects and references from the remote repository into your local repository, and then merge the changes into your project.

You can see a list of all changes in the *PENDING CHANGES* section.

For example, if you make a change to the project from the terminal, the change is automatically detected and appears in the *PENDING CHANGES* section.

Click *Pull* to pull the changes made in the remote repository to your project.
