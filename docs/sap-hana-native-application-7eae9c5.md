# SAP HANA Native Application

Build and deploy native SAP HANA applications or analytical models. This dev space contains a comprehensive set of editors to support the creation of database artifacts \(calculation views, tables, SQLScript procedures, and more\), as well as tools to enable an end-to-end development flow from project creation to the deployment to the SAP BTP.

See [Working with SAP Business Application Studio](https://help.sap.com/viewer/c2b99f19e9264c4d9ae9221b22f6f589/latest/en-US).

> ### Note:  
> SAP Business Application Studio needs to connect to the SAP HANA Cloud instance where you want to deploy your applicationâ€™s database artifacts. By default, SAP HANA Cloud accepts all connections from allowed IP addresses in SAP BTP, for example, in the same region and infrastructure where SAP HANA was provisioned.
> 
> If you are working on an Azure account or you are trying to connect an SAP HANA instance from a different region, you must configure SAP HANA Cloud to allow connections from the IP address hosting SAP Business Application Studio for your Cloud region and the underlying platform.
> 
> To learn how to change the SAP HANA Cloud allowed connections, see [Change Allowed Connections](https://help.sap.com/viewer/db19c7071e5f4101837e23f06e576495/latest/en-US/770d34deb86d4eb49dc944ce9921228c.html).
> 
> To find out your SAP Business Application Studio IP address, see [SAP Business Application Studio Availability](sap-business-application-studio-availability-8509485.md).
