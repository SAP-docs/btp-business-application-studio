# Keyboard Support

Use the keyboard to move selected controls or navigate within the view that you opened with the layout editor.



## Selecting Controls

If you selected a control in the canvas of the layout editor, you can move the selection using the arrow keys:

-   [UP ARROW\]: moves the selection to the parent of the selected control
-   [DOWN ARROW\]: moves the selection to the child of the selected control
-   [LEFT ARROW\]: moves the selection to the control that is up/to the right of the selected control \(within the same aggregation\)
-   [RIGHT ARROW\]: moves the selection to the control that is down/to the left of the selected control \(within the same aggregation\)
-   [CTRL\]+ click: moves the selection to the parent of the selected control



## Moving Selected Controls

If you have selected a control in the canvas of the layout editor, you can change its position within the aggregation:

-   [SHIFT\]+[LEFT ARROW\]: moves the control up/to the right
-   [SHIFT\]+[RIGHT ARROW\]: moves the control down/to the left



## Changing the Drop Target

When you drag and drop a control from the palette to the canvas or from one position within the canvas to another, you can use the keyboard to define the drop position of the dragged control:

-   Use [SHIFT\] or [ALT\] to define the drop position of the dragged control within an aggregation:
    -   [SHIFT\]: moves the drop position up/to the right
    -   [ALT\]: moves the drop position down/to the left
