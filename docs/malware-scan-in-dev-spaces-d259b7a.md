# Malware Scan in Dev Spaces

SAP Business Application Studio scans the user files within the dev spaces for malware.

The scan is triggered every 10 minutes for dev spaces in *Running* state.

If malware is detected, a notification is displayed and the user can delete the file or ignore the message.

In addition, a corresponding entry is written to the audit log of the subaccount from which the user logged in, specifying the file, dev space, and user name where the malware was found.
