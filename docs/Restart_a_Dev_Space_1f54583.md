# Restart a Dev Space

To change the state of a dev space to *Running* perform the following steps:

1.  In your browser, get a list of all workspaces contained in a specific subaccount:

    ```
    https://<sap-business-application-studio-url>/ws-manager/api/v1/workspace?all=true
    ```

2.  Enter your administrator credentials in the login page.
3.  From the list provided, identify the dev space you want to wake up \(for example by searching for the username property\).
4.  Copy the `id` property under the `config` section . This ID is the `<ws-id>` parameter used in the request below.
5.  Copy the `displayname` property under the `labels` section. This display name is the `<display-name>` parameter used in the request below.
6.  Open a new tab in the browser and fetch your JWT token by sending the following request:

    ```
    GET https://<sap-business-application-studio-url>/jwt
    
    ```

7.  Copy the JWT value from the response.
8.  In the REST API tool, send a PUT HTTP request to the following API:

    ```
    PUT https://<sap-business-application-studio-url>/ws-manager/api/v1/workspace/<ws-id>
    
    Request Header:
    X-Approuter-Authorization: Bearer <JWT_Token>
    
    Request Body:
    {"WorkspaceID":"<ws-id>", "Suspended":false, "WorkspaceDisplayName":"<display-name>"}
    ```
