## Cannot Clone Git On Premise Repository

**Problem**

When trying to clone an on premise repository, the following message is displayed:

`fatal: unable to access 'https://user-id@git.wdf.sap.corp/project-name/': Received HTTP code 502 from proxy after CONNECT`

**Reason**

This error indicates that there is no Cloud Connector configured in the account.

**Solution**

You must connect a Cloud Connector. See [Setting Up Git to Work with Gerrit](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/sap-business-application-studio/setting-up-git-to-work-with-gerrit?version=Cloud&comment_id=22268067&show_comments=true) .

## Branch Name Inconsistency

**Problem**

The `master` branch has been renamed to `main` in some Git providers but not in all of them. The default branch name in Git is still `master`, which may cause conflicts.

**Solution**

1.  To check which branches you have locally, use the following Git command:

    ```
    git branch
    ```

2.  Checkout the relevant branch.

    For example, to check out the main branch, use the following Git command:

    ```
    $ git checkout main command
    ```


To define a default branch, refer to the [Git documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-branches-in-your-repository/renaming-a-branch) for the relevant scenario.

## Authentication Fails When Working with the Azure DevOps Git Repository

**Problem**

You try to perform an action when working with the Azure DevOps Git Repository, but authentication fails.



### Authentication Fails During Git Clone

**Problem**

During Git clone, you receive an error that authentication failed.

**Solution**

Instead of entering your user password, [generate a PAT](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows#use-a-pat), and then use the PAT as your password.



### Authentication Fails When Working with Git UI Tools

**Problem**

You try to perform an action when working with Git UI tools, but authentication fails.

**Solution**

There are 2 options for solving this issue:

-   Work with the Git Bash CLI, as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=Windows#use-a-pat).

    Or

-   Save your credentials in the `.gitconfig` file by opening the `.gitconfig` file \(`/home/user/<.gitconfig file>`\) and adding following header:

    ```
    [http]
    
              extraHeader = Authorization: Basic <your_base64_PAT>
    ```
