# Cloning Repositories

Add an existing project to your local workpace by cloning its repository from Git.

1.  Open a terminal.

2.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.

3.  Type `git clone`, and then paste your URL.

    For example:

    > ### Sample Code:  
    > ```
    > $ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
    > ```
