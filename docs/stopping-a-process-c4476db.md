# Stopping a Process

An application may continue to run in the background even if the debugger or and the explorer show it has been stopped.

If this happens, you will get a notification stating that the port is in use.

To correct this:

1.  Open the command palette and select *Ports: Stop the process running on the port*.

2.  Select the relevant port.


> ### Note:  
> This action cannot be reversed. Make sure you select the correct port.
