## Building Multitarget Applications

**Prerequisites**

-   Your dev space must contain a multitarget application.

There are several ways for building multitarget applications in SAP Business Application Studio:

-   From the context menu.
    1.  Right-click on the `mta.yaml` file.
    2.  Choose *Build MTA Project*.

-   From the command palette.
    1.  Enter `MTA`.
    2.  Choose *Build MTA Project*.
    3.  Select the desired `mta.yaml` file.

        > ### Note:  
        > If there’s only one `mta.yaml` available, the build starts automatically.


-   From the *Task Explorer*.

    1.  From the activity bar, click ![Open the Task Explorer view](images/task_explorer_icon_416db7c.png) to open the *Task Explorer* view.
    2.  Click *\+* \(Create Task\).
    3.  Click *Build*.
    4.  Select the MTA project descriptor of the project you want to build.
    5.  Click *Configure* to edit the build configuration parameters.
    6.  Save your changes.

    Use the *Task Explorer* to change the default MTA Build options, for example, to change the default location of the MTA archive or to provide an MTA extension for the build. In the *Task Explorer*, you can save this build configuration for later use.

-   From the CLI. See [Cloud MTA Build Tool](https://sap.github.io/cloud-mta-build-tool/usage/).

The terminal opens showing the output of the build. Once the build is complete, a folder named `mta_archives` is added to the project that contains the relevant MTA archive \(MTAR file\).

> ### Note:  
> If you changed the default configurations using the Task Explorer, the output will correspond to the specified build parameters.

-   Your dev space must contain a multitarget application.
-   Your project must contain an MTA archive \(MTAR\) file.

There are several ways for deploying multitarget applications to SAP Cloud Foundry:

-   From the context menu.
    1.  Right-click on the relevant MTAR file.
