# Storyboard

The Storyboard allows you to develop applications using graphical editors and wizards.

From the Storyboard you can trigger the graphical editors as well as other tools required to develop your application.

The Storyboard provides a graphical view of an application's data models, external data models, services, and UI front ends of the application, as well as the connections between them. This allows for a quick understanding of the applicationâ€™s structure and components.

Depending on the dev space type you select, the storyboard in your dev space will have different features.

The storyboard is available in the , [Full-Stack Application Using Productivity Tools](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/developing-business-applications-using-productivity-tools/storyboard), and [Full Stack Cloud Application](https://help.sap.com/docs/bas/developing-cap-application-in-sap-business-application-studio/storyboard-and-project-explorer) dev spaces.
