# Storyboard

The Storyboard allows you to develop applications using graphical editors and wizards.

From the Storyboard you can trigger the graphical editors as well as other tools required to develop your application.

The Storyboard provides a graphical view of an application's data models, external data models, services, and UI front ends of the application, as well as the connections between them. This allows for a quick understanding of the applicationâ€™s structure and components.

You can move, zoom in and out, and expand and collapse a single component, or all components at once. You can also select a single component and edit its properties in its graphical modeler.

You can filter objects to focus on the application components that are relevant for you.

You can customize the view to show all of the component's connectors and properties, or to show only the component names.

-   To see only the component names, select *Basic View* from the dropdown list.

-   To see the component together with its connectors and properties, select *Detailed View* from the dropdown list.

By default, the Storyboard opens showing the *Basic View*. You can change the default to the *Detailed View* in the *Settings* view.
