# Create a New Function

You can create a new function for a controller from the *Events* pane.



## Procedure

1.  On the canvas, select a control.

2.  In the *Events* pane, open the dropdown list under the event for whose controller you want to create a function.

3.  In the dropdown list, select *New Function*.

4.  In the *New Function* dialog box, enter a function name and click *OK*.

    > ### Note:  
    > The function name you enter must be a valid JavaScript function name.

    After entering the name for your new function, the code is created by the layout editor in the code editor. To go directly to that code, click the *Go to code* ![Go to code icon](images/events_icon_91db674.jpg) icon next to the new function name in the *Events* pane.
