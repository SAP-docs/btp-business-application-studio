# Creating a Project using the Wizard

You can create projects based on your development scenario and your installed extensions using predefined templates.

1.  Open the wizard in one of the following ways:

    -   Go to *File* \> *New Project from Template*.
    -   Select *Create project from template* from the Welcome page.
    -   Enter ***Create Project*** in the command palette and select *SAP Business Application Studio : Create Project from Template*.
    The Project Wizard opens showing the project templates that are relevant for the dev space you created and for the additional extensions you selected.

2.  Follow the wizard steps and provide the required information. You can move between steps using the *Previous* and *Next* buttons or clicking the steps from the wizard tree.

    The wizard displays error notifications on the field level as well as on the step level.

3.  If you already have an open workspace, at the conclusion of the wizard choose whether you want to open the project in a new workspace or add it to the existing one, thus moving to multi-root mode.

The wizard generates the project including the relevant folder structure, artifacts, and resources.
