# Application Plans

SAP Business Application Studio provides three types of application plans in SAP BTP enterprise accounts: standard-edition, free, and build-code.

You select the plan when subscribing to the application. See [Subscribe to SAP Business Application Studio](subscribe-to-sap-business-application-studio-6331319.md).

The type of plan you choose determines pricing, conditions of use, and resources. Learn about the plan details in the [SAP Discovery Center](https://discovery-center.cloud.sap/#/serviceCatalog/business-application-studio).

-   Use the **standard plan** for productive development in pre-configured dev spaces.
-   Use the **free plan** for evaluation purposes. Restrictions apply to the development environments. Only community support is available for free tier service plans and these are not subject to SLAs.
-   Use the **build-code plan** for productive AI-based development. This option is available only if your subaccount is subscribed to SAP Build Code.

The plans provide preinstalled runtimes and tools tailored for developing key scenarios such as: SAP S/4HANA extensions, full stack business applications, SAP Fiori applications, and more. However, the free plan contains some restrictions. See [Free Plan Restrictions](application-plans-2c72917.md#loio2c72917df87e47c290e061a556d92398__section_v4w_f1z_tpb).

Each subaccount has only 1 subscription. If you want to move to another service plan, see [Changing Plans](changing-plans-4cf7c69.md).

You can use different plans in separate subaccounts.
