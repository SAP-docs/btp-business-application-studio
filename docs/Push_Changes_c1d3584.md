# Push Changes

The Push option incorporates all unsynced committed changes into the remote branch of the currently checked-out local branch.



The number of unsynced committed changes is displayed next to the repository name. All tags created within the open repository are pushed.

### NOTE
> Remember Always Pull Before a Push. This action will make sure that your local copy is synced with the remote repository.
> Maybe other team members have been pushing to the remote repository. If you push before syncing up,
> you could end up with some problems like HEADS annotations or MERGE CONFLICTS.
