# Additional Extensions

You can extend and enrich your development environment with tools and capabilities based on your needs.

Each dev space contains a group of extensions that enhance its existing functionality. Some extensions are predefined by each development scenario, and others can be manually enabled based on your specific development needs.

The extensions may be used to add specific tools or to add an additional scenario to the dev space.

The list below shows a selection of our most used additional extensions.

> ### Note:  
> To learn more about the predefined extensions, see [Dev Space Types](dev-space-types-4142f78.md).
