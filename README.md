# Contributions to SAP Business Application Studio Documentation

Found a mistake in our documentation? Always wanted to add a step in one of our procedures that could save many others a lot of time? Then you're at the right place! All contributions made to the Markdown files in the [docs](docs) directory are reviewed, and if deemed valuable be added to our [official documentation on SAP Help Portal](https://help.sap.com/webcomponents/products/SAP%20Business%20Application%20Studio/9d1db9835307451daa8c930fbd9ab264/8f46c6e6f86641cc900871c903761fd4.html). The easiest way is to start there, and choose _Edit_ to find the right Markdown file to contribute to.

> Contributions to the scenario documentation must still be done by providing feedback on the SAP Help Portal.

    * Choose *Feedback* > *Create issue* to open a GitHub issue in this repository.

If you only make a small contribution, that's the quickest way to propose a change. For larger contributions, we recommend forking this repository to work locally. The filenames in the [docs](docs) directory are created based on the title of the page on SAP Help Portal.
